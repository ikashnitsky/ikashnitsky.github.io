    "text": "This week, the 30-th issue of my Demographic Digest was published.\nDemographic Digest is my project that started in November 2015. Twice a month I select fresh demographic papers and write brief summaries of them in Russian to be published in Demoscope Weekly, the most popular Russian journal/website in social sciences. If you read Russian, you may want to browse the archive or visit the website of the project (which is still to be filled).\nThe project is in the transitional phase now. Since 2016 Demographic Digest welcomes contributions from from external authors. In February 2017 I launched the first iteration of a project for the students of National Research University Higher School of Economics.\nFor that, I exported the bibliographic data of all the papers covered in Demographic Digest. I use Zotero as a reference manager; the paper records are exported as a single .bib file, which I then saved as a plain text (.txt) file. Then I read this data in R, cleaned it, and finally visualized.\nFor one journal title, Ageing and Society, I failed to replace the “&” using regular expressions. This one is to be fixed manually. I also corrected the title of Lancet journal removing the article “The”. Finally, I corrected the frequencies for Population Studies and Population and Development Review subtracting 6, because for both journals I provided lists of most cited papers as a bonus. Following the same logic, I cleaned the data from the papers that appeared in the bonus part.\nTo provide some additional metrics of the journals, I downloaded bibliometric data from the SCImago Journal & Country Rank projecthttp://www.scimagojr.com/aboutus.php. Demographic journals usually have rather low SJR, compared to medical journals; that’s why I downloaded the data only for journals in Social Sciences (the.xlsx file). Then I read the data in R and join to my data frame."

    "text": "NUTS stands for the Nomenclature of Territorial Units For Statistics. The history of NUTS dates back to the beginning of 1970s, when European countries developed unified standards for systems of administrative geography. It was not until the beginning of this century when such a system finally became widely used. There are three main hierarchical levels of NUTS, and the most commonly used for regional analysis is NUTS-2.\nFigure 1. Illustration of the principle of NUTS hierarchical system\nOne of the objectives of NUTS was to provide more or less comparable administrative divisions for all countries of Europe. Nevertheless, in 2013, population figures for single NUTS-2 regions ranged from 28.5 thousands in Aland island (Finland) to almost 12 million in Ile-de-France (Paris and surroundings, France)."

    "text": "The broken time series\nQuite arbitrary in its essence, territorial division tends to evolve. Changes in administrative boundaries can cause problems for regional analysis as they break the time series and therefore make it harder to analyze trends. Despite this inconvenience, the boundaries of regions actually change quite often based on the needs and interests of local or national governmenta. Eurostat tracks all modifications providing detailed explanations of all the changes that happen between versions of NUTS (figure 2).\nFigure 2. Changes in NUTS between versions 2006 and 2010\nDespite this, Eurostat does not recalculate historic demographic data to match the most recent NUTS version. This means that, for the most recent version of NUTS, there is missing data for all years before the latest administrative change. So researchers have to reconstruct historical data manually to obtain a long time series. Of course, crude assumptions often have to be accepted in order to approximate the population figures for the current regions that did not exist in the past.\nTo make thing even more complex, Eurostat provides the data only for the latest version of NUTS (at least, I did not work out how to download previous versions). In my PhD project I carry out regional analysis for the NUTS-2 regions of European Union. To have the longest possible time series, when I did the data preparation in 2015, I chose the 2010 version of NUTS, on which the regional demographic projection EUROPOP2013 is based. For reproducibility, I uploaded the precise versions of the Eurostat data at NUTS-2 level on population age structures and deaths, as downloaded in 2015, to figshare."

    "section": "Denmark",
    "text": "Denmark\nSome countries had to perform major changes in their systems of territorial division to fit the NUTS standards. The most significant reform happened in Denmark in 2007, where the former 271 municipalities were transformed into the new 98 municipalities. At the same time, NUTS was introduced, so that 98 municipalities were allocated to 11 NUTS-3 regions, which aggregate to 5 NUTS-2 regions. Typically, for a small country, there is only one NUTS-1 region in Denmark, which is the whole country.\nAs far as I know, there was no official attempt of Eurostat to reconstruct the time series for Denmark before 2007. The typical map of Eurostat for the pre-2007 period shows Denmark as “no data available” country (figure 3).\nFigure 3. Life expectancy at birth in European NUTS-2 regions, 2006; a screenshot from the Eurostat’s interactive data exploratory tool\nSuch a data loss is somewhat surprising for a country such as Denmark. It might be quite difficult to match the old and new municipal systems; but it should be relatively easy to re-aggregate the old municipalities into the new (higher level) NUTS regions. That is precisely what I did during my data preparation1 and what I now want to share in this post.1 I have spent quite some time searching if someone else did the job before me and failed to find.\nThe task is basically to identify which of the old 271 municipalities are located within the modern 11 NUTS-3 regions and to aggregate the municipal data. Then, NUTS-3 data is easily aggregated for the NUTS-2 level. Such a task could have meant working late into the night, but luckily we live in the GIS era. I used GIS to match the old municipalities with the NUTS-3 regions. Here I want to show (with code) how the task can be performed using the amazing and opensource R. Below I show the process of matching old municipalities to the NUTS regions and the process that I used to aggregate population data."

The system only allows you to grab up to 10K cells for unregistered users and up to 100K for registered users. So the process of downloading the data involves some tedious manual manipulations. For the purpose of my phd project, I downloaded the data for the period 2001-2006; but, if needed, the data is available since 1979. The data, downloaded in 2015 and ‘tidied up’ can be found here.\nI have spent a lot of time trying to find geodata with the boundaries of the old municipalities. Now, coming back to the topic more than 1.5 year later, I failed to identify the original source of the shapefile, though I am pretty sure that it came from here 2. The copy of the shapefile that I used can be found here.2 There is a note on the website saying that, due to a planned change in the structure of the website, there might be some problems with data accuisition. I failed to download the geodata on 2017-02-23.\nFinally, we need a shapefile of NUTS-3 regions. It can be easily downloaded from Eurostat geodata repository. The shapefile that I used is “NUTS_2010_20M_SH.zip”.

This is not a problem as long as all the centroids of the municipalities fall within the boundaries of the NUTS-3 regions, which seems to be true for all municipalities except for the easternmost one. A quick check reveals that this is Christiansø, a tiny fortified island, whose history goes back to the Middle Ages. It has a special status and is not included into the NUTS system. For further manipulations, Christiansø can safely merge it with the close-by Bornholm.\nTo identify which municipalities fall into which NUTS regions, I use the spatial overlap function (over) from sp package.

The spatial layer for municipalities does not contain the codes that are used by Statistics Denmark, so I have to match municipalities in the two datasets by their names. This is quite a difficult task. Names can be written slightly differently, there are some special characters in Danish alphabet, and some municipalities may have experienced a change of name. To solve the task most efficiently, I used the ‘Fuzzy String Matching’ approach which is implemented in the fuzzyjoin package by David Robinson.\nFirst, I simplify the names in both datasets turning them into lowercase, replacing the character “å” with “aa”, and removing the “Kommune” word in the spatial dataset names. Please note that I downloaded (separately) a small selection from Statistics Denmark to have a lightweight dataframe with municipal codes and names.\n\n# simplify municipalities names\nmun_geo <- mun_coord %>%         \n        transmute(name = sub(x = name, \" Kommune\", replacement = \"\"), objectid) %>% \n        mutate(name = gsub(x = tolower(name), \"å\", \"aa\"))\n\nmun_stat <- read.csv2(\"https://ikashnitsky.github.io/share/1703-nuts2-denmark/stat-codes-names.csv\", \n                      fileEncoding = danish_ecnoding) %>% \n        select(name) %>% \n        separate(name, into = c(\"code\", \"name\"), sep = \" \", extra = \"merge\") %>% \n        mutate(name = gsub(\"\\\\s*\\\\([^\\\\)]+\\\\)\", \"\", x = name)) %>% \n        mutate(name = gsub(x = tolower(name), \"å\", \"aa\"))\n\nLet’s try fuzzy join.\n\n# first attempt\nfuz_joined_1 <- regex_left_join(mun_geo, mun_stat, by = \"name\")\n\nThe resulting dataframe has 278 rows instead of 271. That means that for some municipalities in the spatial dataset there was more than one match. Let’s identify them.\n\n# identify more that 1 match (7 cases) and select which to drop\nfuz_joined_1 %>% group_by(objectid) %>% mutate(n = n()) %>% filter(n > 1)\n\n\n## Source: local data frame [14 x 5]\n## Groups: objectid [7]\n## \n##         name.x objectid  code      name.y     n\n##          <chr>    <dbl> <chr>       <chr> <int>\n## 1       haslev   105112   313      haslev     2\n## 2       haslev   105112   403       hasle     2\n## 3  brønderslev    47003   739       rønde     2\n## 4  brønderslev    47003   805 brønderslev     2\n## 5    hirtshals    47037   817        hals     2\n## 6    hirtshals    47037   819   hirtshals     2\n## 7      rønnede    46378   385     rønnede     2\n## 8      rønnede    46378   407       rønne     2\n## 9     hvidebæk    46268   317    hvidebæk     2\n## 10    hvidebæk    46268   681     videbæk     2\n## 11    ryslinge    46463   477    ryslinge     2\n## 12    ryslinge    46463   737          ry     2\n## 13     aarslev    46494   497     aarslev     2\n## 14     aarslev    46494   861        aars     2\n\nSo, for 7 municipalities, two matches were found. I will drop the imperfect match variants in the next iteration of fuzzy join.\nThe other issue is the municipalities for which no match was found in that statistical data.\n\n# show the non-matched cases\nfuz_joined_1 %>% filter(is.na(code))\n\n\n##              name.x objectid code name.y\n## 1              faxe   105120 <NA>   <NA>\n## 2 nykøbing falsters    46349 <NA>   <NA>\n## 3       herstederne    46101 <NA>   <NA>\n\nAs there are only three such cases, I corrected them manually in the spatial data to match the statistical data. There are two cases of a difference in the way the name of municipality are written and one case of name change.\n\n# correct the 3 non-matching geo names\nmun_geo_cor <- mun_geo\n\nmun_geo_cor[mun_geo_cor$name==\"faxe\", \"name\"] <- \"fakse\"\nmun_geo_cor[mun_geo_cor$name==\"nykøbing falsters\", \"name\"] <- \"nykøbing f.\"\nmun_geo_cor[mun_geo_cor$name==\"herstederne\", \"name\"] <- \"albertslund\"\n\nNow the second attempt to match the datasets (spatial dataset is corrected).\n\n# second attempt\nfuz_joined_2 <- regex_left_join(mun_geo_cor, mun_stat, by = \"name\")\n\n# drop non-perfect match\nfuz_joined_2 <- fuz_joined_2 %>% \n        group_by(objectid) %>% \n        mutate(n = n()) %>% \n        ungroup() %>% \n        filter(n < 2 | name.x==name.y)\n\nfuz_joined_2 <- fuz_joined_2 %>% transmute(name = name.x, objectid, code)\n\nThe output looks perfect. Now, the last step – using the matched “objectid” field, I will finally attach the NUTS data to statistical codes.\n\n# finally, attach the NUTS info to matched table\nkey <- left_join(fuz_joined_2, fixed, \"objectid\")"

There are more males being born, then eventually the sex ratio levels due to higher male mortality (see my previous post). Though, male mortality was not always much higher. Back in the days, when infant mortality was much higher and women used to have much higher fertility, there was almost no gender gap in age-specific mortality levels. Constant pregnancy and frequent childbirths had a strong negative impact on female health and survival statistics. We can see that only in the second half of the 20-th century gender gap in mortality became substantial in Sweden.\n\n\n\nThis post is based on my earlier tweet and gist."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Sex ratios reflect the two basic regularities of human demographics: 1) there are always more boys being born; 2) males experience higher mortality throughout their life-course. The sex ratio at birth does not vary dramatically1 and is more or less constant at the level of 105-106 boys per 100 girls. Hence, differences in the sex ratio profiles of countries mainly reflect gender gap in mortality. In this post I will compare sex ratios age profiles in all countries included in Human Mortality Database.1 There are cases of big deviations from this natural constant. The most well known one is the skewed sex ratio in China, where decades of One Child Policy together with strong traditional son preference resulted in selective abortions. Read more: Frejka et. al (2010); Wang (2011); Basten and Verropoulou (2013).\nR gives amazing opportunities to grab data fast and easy. Thanks to Tim Riffe’s HMDHFDplus package, one can now download HMD data with just a couple of lines of R code.\nThere is a handy function in HMDHFDplus package – getHMDcountries(). It lists the codes for all countries in HMD. So it becomes really easy to loop through the database and download data for all countries.\n\n# load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # version 1.0.0\nlibrary(HMDHFDplus) # version 1.1.8\n\ncountry <- getHMDcountries()\n\nexposures <- list()\nfor (i in 1: length(country)) {\n        cnt <- country[i]\n        exposures[[cnt]] <- readHMDweb(cnt, \"Exposures_1x1\",\n                                       ik_user_hmd, ik_pass_hmd)\n        \n        # let's print the progress\n        paste(i,'out of',length(country)) \n}\n\nPlease note, the arguments ik_user_hmd and ik_pass_hmd are my login credidantials at the website of Human Mortality Database, which are stored locally at my computer. In order to access the data, one needs to create an account at http://www.mortality.org/ and provide his own credidantials to the readHMDweb() function.\nNext, I select 2012 for comparison – it is quite recent, and for most of the HMD countries there are data for 2012. The loop goes through each of the countries’ dataframe in exposures list, selects data for 2012 and calculates sex ratio at each age. I also remove data for several populations (like East and West Germany separately).\n\nsr_age <- list()\n\nfor (i in 1:length(exposures)) {\n        di <- exposures[[i]]\n        sr_agei <- di %>% select(Year,Age,Female,Male) %>% \n                filter(Year %in% 2012) %>%\n                select(-Year) %>%\n                transmute(country = names(exposures)[i],\n                          age = Age, sr_age = Male / Female * 100)\n        sr_age[[i]] <- sr_agei\n}\nsr_age <- bind_rows(sr_age)\n\n# remove optional populations\nsr_age <- sr_age %>% filter(!country %in% c(\"FRACNP\",\"DEUTE\",\"DEUTW\",\"GBRCENW\",\"GBR_NP\"))\n\nAfter age 90, sex ratios become quite jerky due to the relatively small numbers of survivors. I decided to aggregate data after the age 90.\n\n# summarize all ages older than 90 (too jerky)\nsr_age_90 <- sr_age %>% filter(age %in% 90:110) %>% \n        group_by(country) %>% summarise(sr_age = mean(sr_age, na.rm = T)) %>%\n        ungroup() %>% transmute(country, age=90, sr_age)\n\ndf_plot <- bind_rows(sr_age %>% filter(!age %in% 90:110), sr_age_90)\n\nFinally, I plot the resulting sex ratios.\n\n# get nice font\nlibrary(extrafont)\nmyfont <- \"Roboto Condensed\"\n\n# finaly - plot\ngg <- ggplot(df_plot, aes(age, sr_age, color = country, group = country))+\n        geom_hline(yintercept = 100, color = 'grey50', size = 1)+\n        geom_line(size = 1)+\n        scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 120), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 120, 20))+\n        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 90), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20))+\n        xlab('Age')+\n        ylab('Sex ratio, males per 100 females')+\n        facet_wrap(~country, ncol=6)+\n        theme_minimal(base_family = myfont, base_size = 15)+\n        theme(legend.position='none',\n              panel.border = element_rect(size = .5, fill = NA))\n\ngg\n\n\nThere is quite a variety in the sex ratio profiles. If the initial prevalence of males equalizes in Japan, Sweden, or Norway at around 60, in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine this happens at around 30 due to very high male mortality. In many countries there are pronounced bumps in the sex ratio at ages 20-30, that are likely to be caused by international migration. For example, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Portugal, and New Zealand are experiencing substantial outflow of young men.\nWhat happened in Taiwan?\n\n\nThis post is based on my earlier tweet and gist."

According to Human Mortality Database data (2010), the probability for a Russian men to survive from 20 to 60 was just 0.64 1. For women the probability is 0.87. This huge gender disproportion in mortality results in a peculiar sex ratio profile (see my old DemoTrends post and the previous blog post).1 To compare, the same probabilities for males in some developed countries are: France (0.89), Japan (0.92), US (0.87), UK (0.91).\nNow let’s compare age-specific mortality rates of Russian men to that of the Japanese. For years and years Japan performs best in reducing mortality. It became standard to compare mortality schedules of other countries to the Japanese one 2.2 See for example the recent NIDI working paper of Balachandran et. al (2017).\nFirst, I need to get HMD data for both Russian and Japanese males.

    "section": "",
    "text": "The 2017 Ice Hockey World Championship has started. Thus I want to share a small research on the height of ice hockey players that I did almost a year ago and published in Russian.\nWhen the TV camera shows the players returning to the changing rooms, it is difficult not to notice just how huge the players are compared to the surrounding people – fans, journalists, coaches, or the ice arena workers. For example, here are the rising stars of the Finnish hockey – Patrik Laine and Aleksander Barkov – with the two fans in between.\nSource\nSo the questions arise. Are ice hockey players really taller than average people? How is the height of ice hockey players evolving over time? Are there any lasting differences between countries?\nData\nIIHF, the organization that is in charge for the ice hockey world championships, publishes detailed information on the squads, including the data on player’s height and weight. The raw data files are here. I gathered the data of all players that participated in the 16 world championships between 2001 and 2016. The formatting of the data files changes from year to year complicating the data processing. So I did the data cleaning manually which took a bit more than 3 hours. The unifies dataset is here. Let’s load the data and prepare the R session.\n\n# load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # data manipulation and viz\nlibrary(lubridate) # easy manipulations with dates\nlibrary(ggthemes) # themes for ggplot2\nlibrary(texreg) # easy export of regression tables\nlibrary(xtable) # export a data frame into an html table\nlibrary(sysfonts) # change the font in figures\n\n\n# download the IIHF data set; if there are some problems, you can download manually\n# using the stable URL (https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3394735.v2)\ndf <- read.csv(\"https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/5303173\")\n\n# color palette\nbrbg11 <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, \"BrBG\")\n\nDo the players become taller? (a crude comparison)\nLet’s first have a look at the pulled average height of all the players that participated.\n\n# mean height by championship\ndf_per <- df %>% group_by(year) %>%\n        summarise(height = mean(height))\n\ngg_period_mean <- ggplot(df_per, aes(x = year, y = height))+\n        geom_point(size = 3, color = brbg11[9])+\n        stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", size = 1, color = brbg11[11])+\n        ylab(\"height, cm\")+\n        xlab(\"year of competition\")+\n        scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2005, 2015, 5), labels = seq(2005, 2015, 5))+\n        theme_few(base_size = 15, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"grey75\", size = .25))\n\n\ngg_period_jitter <- ggplot(df, aes(x = year, y = height))+\n        geom_jitter(size = 2, color = brbg11[9], alpha = .25, width = .75)+\n        stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", size = 1, se = F, color = brbg11[11])+\n        ylab(\"height, cm\")+\n        xlab(\"year of competition\")+\n        scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(2005, 2015, 5), labels = seq(2005, 2015, 5))+\n        theme_few(base_size = 15, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"grey75\", size = .25))\n\ngg_period <- cowplot::plot_grid(gg_period_mean, gg_period_jitter)\n\n\nFigure 1. The dynamics of the average height of the ice hockey players at the world championships, 2001–2016\nThe positive trend is evident. In the 15 years the average height of a player increased by almost 2 cm (left panel). Is that a lot? To have an idea, we will compare this growth to the dynamics in the population, later in the post.\nCohort approach\nA more correct way to study the dynamics of players’ height is to do the comparison between birth cohorts. Here we face an interesting data preparation issue – some of the players participated in more that one championships. The question is: do we need to clean the duplicate records? If the goal is to see the average height of a player at the certain championship (as in Figure 1), it is reasonable to keep all the records. Alternatively, if the aim is to analyze the dynamics of players’ height itself, I argue, it would be wrong to assign bigger weight to those players that participated in more that one championship. Thus, for the further cohort analysis, I cleaned the dataset from the duplicates.\n\ndfu_h <- df %>% select(year, name, country, position, birth, cohort, height) %>%\n        spread(year, height)\ndfu_h$av.height <- apply(dfu_h[, 6:21], 1, mean, na.rm = T)\ndfu_h$times_participated <- apply(!is.na(dfu_h[, 6:21]), 1, sum)\n\ndfu_w <- df %>% select(year, name, country, position, birth, cohort, weight) %>%\n        spread(year, weight)\ndfu_w$av.weight <- apply(dfu_w[, 6:21], 1, mean, na.rm = T)\n\n\ndfu <- left_join(dfu_h %>% select(name, country, position, birth, cohort, av.height, times_participated), \n                 dfu_w %>% select(name, country, position, birth, cohort, av.weight), \n                 by = c(\"name\", \"country\", \"position\", \"birth\", \"cohort\")) %>%\n        mutate(bmi = av.weight / (av.height / 100) ^ 2)\n\nThe total number of observations decreased from 6292 to 3333. For those who participated in more that one championship, I averaged the data on height and weight as they can change during the life-course. How many times, on average, are ice hockey players honored to represent their countries in the world championships? A bit less than 2.\n\n# frequencies of participation in world championships\nmean(dfu$times_participated)\n\ndf_part <- as.data.frame(table(dfu$times_participated))\n\ngg_times_part <- ggplot(df_part, aes(y = Freq, x = Var1))+\n        geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = brbg11[8])+\n        ylab(\"# of players\")+\n        xlab(\"times participated (out of 16 possible)\")+\n        theme_few(base_size = 15, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"grey75\", size = .25))\n\n\nFigure 2.

But it has to be noted that not every player had a possibility to participate in all the 16 championships between 2001 and 2016. That depends on a numder of factors:\n- the birth cohort of the player; - whether his national team regularly qualified for the championship (Figure 3); - whether the player was good enough for the national team; - whether he was free from the NHL play-offs that often keep the best players off the world championships.\n\n# countries times participated\ndf_cnt_part <- df %>% select(year, country, no) %>%\n        mutate(country = factor(paste(country))) %>%\n        group_by(country, year) %>%\n        summarise(value = sum(as.numeric(no))) %>%\n        mutate(value = 1) %>%\n        ungroup() %>%\n        mutate(country = factor(country, levels = rev(levels(country))), \n               year = factor(year))\n\nd_cnt_n <- df_cnt_part %>% group_by(country) %>%\n        summarise(n = sum(value))\n\ngg_cnt_part <- ggplot(data = df_cnt_part, aes(x = year, y = country))+\n        geom_point(color = brbg11[11], size = 7)+\n        geom_text(data = d_cnt_n, aes(y = country, x = 17.5, label = n, color = n), size = 7, fontface = 2)+\n        geom_text(data = d_cnt_n, aes(y = country, x = 18.5, label = \" \"), size = 7)+\n        scale_color_gradientn(colours = brbg11[7:11])+\n        xlab(NULL)+\n        ylab(NULL)+\n        theme_bw(base_size = 25, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n              axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))\n\n\nFigure 3. Stats of the national teams participation in the world championships\nDo the ice hochey players become taller? (regression analysis)\nThe regression analysis allows to address the research question – the association between player’s height and birth cohort – accounting for the cross-national differences and player’s position. I use OLS regressions, that are quite sensitive to outliers. I removed the birth cohorts for which there are less than 10 players – 1963, 1997, and 1998.\n\n# remove small cohorts\ntable(dfu$cohort)\ndfuc <- dfu %>% filter(cohort < 1997, cohort > 1963)\n\nSo, the results.

One year change in the birth cohort year is associated with an increase of 0.1 cm in height. The coefficient is statistically significant, yet the variable explains only 1% of the variance. That’s not a big problem since the aim of the modeling is to document the differences, rather than predict based on the model. Nevertheless, the low coefficient of determination means that there are other variables that explain the differences in players’ height better than just the birth cohort.\nModel 2. Defenders are the tallest ice hockey players: goalkeepers are 2 cm shorter, forwards are 2.6 cm shorter. All the coefficients are significant; R squared rose to 6%. It is worth noting that the coefficient for the birth cohort did not change when we added the new variable.\nModel 3. It is interesting to control for countries for two reasons. First, some of the differences are significant themselves. For example, Swedes, Slovaks, and Canadians are higher than Russians. In contrast, Japanese are 5.2 cm shorter, Italians – 3.6 cm, French – 2.2 cm (figure 4). Second, once the country controls are introduced, the coefficient for birth cohort decreased slightly meaning that some of the differences in height are explained by persisting cross-country differences. R squared rose to 13%.\n\n# players' height by country\ngg_av.h_country <- ggplot(dfuc , aes(x = factor(cohort), y = av.height))+\n        geom_point(color = \"grey50\", alpha = .25)+\n        stat_summary(aes(group = country), geom = \"line\", fun.y = mean, size = .5, color = \"grey50\")+\n        stat_smooth(aes(group = country, color = country), geom = \"line\", size = 1)+\n        facet_wrap(~country, ncol = 4)+\n        coord_cartesian(ylim = c(170, 195))+\n        scale_x_discrete(labels = paste(seq(1970, 1990, 10)), breaks = paste(seq(1970, 1990, 10)))+\n        labs(x = \"birth cohort\", y = \"height, cm\")+\n        theme_few(base_size = 15, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n              panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"grey75\", size = .25))\n\n\nFigure 4. The height of ice hockey players by nations\nThe last model indicates that from one birth cohort cohort to the other the height of ice hockey players increases 0.08 cm. That means an increase of 0.8 cm in a decade or a growth of 2.56 cm in the 32 years between 1964 and 1996. It is worth mentioning that once we run the analysis in cohorts and controlling for positions and nations, the speed of the player’s height increase becomes much humbler than in the crude pulled analysis (Figure 1): 0.8 cm per decade compared to 1.2 cm per decade.\nBefore we go further and compare the growth in player’s height to that of the population, let’s do the modeling separately for defenders, goalkeepers, and forwards. The exploratory plot (Figure 5) suggests that the correlation is stronger for goalkeepers and weaker for defenders.\n\ndfuc_pos <- dfuc\nlevels(dfuc_pos$position) <- c(\"Defenders\", \"Forwards\", \"Goalkeeprs\")\n\ngg_pos <- ggplot(dfuc_pos , aes(x = cohort, y = av.height))+\n        geom_jitter(aes(color = position), alpha = .5, size = 2)+\n        stat_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = T, color = brbg11[11], size = 1)+\n        scale_x_continuous(labels = seq(1970, 1990, 10), breaks = seq(1970, 1990, 10))+\n        scale_color_manual(values = brbg11[c(8, 9, 10)])+\n        facet_wrap(~position, ncol = 3)+\n        xlab(\"birth cohort\")+\n        ylab(\"height, cm\")+\n        theme_few(base_size = 15, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n              panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"grey75\", size = .25))\n\n\nFigure 5.

In three decades the average height of the goalkeepers increased by 7 cm!\nFinally, let’s compare these dynamics with those in the population.\nCompare to population\nOur previous results expose significant height differences between players of various nations. Thus, it is reasonable to compare ice hockey players’ height to the corresponding male population of their countries.\nFor the data on the height of males in population in the corresponding nations I used the relevant scientific paper.

The comparison of height dynamics in ice hockey players (brown) and the corresponding male populations (green)\nIn all the analyzed countries, ice hockey players are 2-5 cm higher that the nation’s average. This is not very surprising since we expect some selection in sport. What is more interesting, in the developed countries the rapid increase in the height of males mostly leveled off in the birth cohorts of 1960s. Unlike the population trend, the height of ice hockey players continued to increase with roughly the same pace in all the analyzed countries except for Denmark.\nFor the cohorts of Europeans that were born in first half of 20-th century, the height of males increased by 1.18–1.74 cm per decade (Figure 7, middle panel). Starting from the birth cohorts of 1960s, the pace decreased to 0.15–0.80 per decade.\n\n# growth in population\n\ndf_hb_w <- df_hb %>% spread(cohort, h_pop) \nnames(df_hb_w)[2:26] <- paste(\"y\", names(df_hb_w)[2:26])\n\ndiffs <- df_hb_w[, 3:26]-df_hb_w[, 2:25]\n\ndf_hb_gr<- df_hb_w %>%\n        transmute(country, \n                  gr_1961_1980 = unname(apply(diffs[, 22:24], 1, mean, na.rm = T))*2, \n                  gr_1901_1960 = unname(apply(diffs[, 9:21], 1, mean, na.rm = T))*2, \n                  gr_1856_1900 = unname(apply(diffs[, 1:8], 1, mean, na.rm = T))*2) %>%\n        gather(\"period\", \"average_growth\", 2:4) %>%\n        filter(country %in% both_cnt) %>%\n        mutate(country = factor(country, levels = rev(levels(factor(country)))), \n               period = factor(period, labels = c(\"1856-1900\", \"1901-1960\", \"1961-1980\")))\n\n\ngg_hb_growth <- ggplot(df_hb_gr, aes(x = average_growth, y = country))+\n        geom_point(aes(color = period), size = 3)+\n        scale_color_manual(values = brbg11[c(8, 3, 10)])+\n        scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 2.15))+\n        facet_wrap(~period)+\n        theme_few()+\n        xlab(\"average growth in men's height over 10 years, cm\")+\n        ylab(NULL)+\n        theme_few(base_size = 20, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n              panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"grey75\", size = .25))\n\n\nFigure 7. Average changes in male population\nThe height increase for ice hockey players seems quite impressive if we compare it to the stagnating dynamics in the corresponding male populations. And the acceleration of goalkeepers’ height is outright amazing.\nThe diverging trends in the height of ice hockey players and normal population is likely to be driven by the strengthening selection in sport.\nSelection in ice hockey\nLooking through the literature on the selection in sport, I saw the finding that showed a notable disproportion of professional sportsmen by the month of birth. There are much more sportsmen that were born in the first half of the year. They have a lasting advantage since the kids teams are usually formed by birth cohorts. Thus, those born earlier in the year always have a bit more time lived compared to their later born team mates, which means that they are physically more mature. It is easy to test the finding on our ice hockey players dataset.\n\n# check if there are more players born in earlier months\ndf_month <- df %>% mutate(month = month(birth)) %>%\n        mutate(month = factor(month))\n\ngg_month <- ggplot(df_month, aes(x = factor(month)))+\n        geom_bar(stat = \"count\", fill = brbg11[8])+\n        scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb)+\n        labs(x = \"month of birth\", y = \"# of players\")+\n        theme_few(base_size = 20, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n              panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"grey75\", size = .25))\n\n\nFigure 8. The distribution of ice hockey players by month of birth\nTrue, the distribution is notably skewed – there are much more players born in earlier months. When I further split the dataset by the decades of birth, it becomes clear that the effect becomes more evident with time (Figure 9). Indirectly, that means that the selection in ice hockey becomes tougher.\n\n# facet by decades\ndf_month_dec <- df_month %>%\n        mutate(dec = substr(paste(cohort), 3, 3) %>% \n                       factor(labels = paste(\"born in\", c(\"1960s\", \"1970s\", \"1980s\", \"1990s\"))))\n\ngg_month_dec <- ggplot(df_month_dec, aes(x = factor(month)))+\n        geom_bar(stat = \"count\", fill = brbg11[8])+\n        scale_x_discrete(breaks = 1:12, labels = month.abb)+\n        labs(x = \"month of birth\", y = \"# of players\")+\n        facet_wrap(~dec, ncol = 2, scales = \"free\")+\n        theme_few(base_size = 20, base_family = \"mono\")+\n        theme(legend.position = \"none\", \n              panel.grid = element_line(colour = \"grey75\", size = .25))\n\n\nFigure 9.

    "title": "Hacking maps with ggplot2",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This is a very short post on mapping with ggplot2.\nQuite often, mapping some data, we do not need to follow scrupulously the formal requirements to geographical maps – the idea is just to show the spatial dimension of the data. For instance, the network of rivers is not the most important information when we map the elections outcome. Thus, the simplified mapping allows quite some freedom in transforming the geodata. The classical example of such geodata transformation is the replacement and scaling of Alaska and Hawaii to be mapped alongside the mainland of the US. As one may see in this example, usually such geodata transformations utilize quite complex GIS tools in order to reposition an object in the coordinate system.\nThe interesting feature of mapping with ggplot2 is that, before the actual plotting, geodata has to be fotrified (ggplot2::fortify) – transformed to a simple dataframe object. Since fortified geodata is basically a dataframe, some simple transformations could be made really easily.\nIn my last paper, I needed to show a two-dimensional grouping of the European NUTS-2 regions in 4 quadrants according to GDP per capita and the share of working-age population (see Figure 8 in the preprint). In line with the study setting, I did the grouping separately for Western, Southern, and Eastern Europe. I decided that the most straightforward way to show that on map would be to visually separate the 3 subregions of Europe. The task is easily doable through triggering the fortified geodata object – see the code below.\nFirst, the code to prepare the R session and load the (already prepared) data.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse) # version 1.1.1\nlibrary(extrafont) # version 0.17\nlibrary(ggthemes) # version 3.4.0\nfont <- \"Roboto Condensed\"\nlibrary(hrbrthemes) # version 0.1.0\n# The code is tested on a PC-win7-x64\n# R version 3.3.3\n\n\n# load the prepared geodata and stat data\nload(url(\"https://ikashnitsky.github.io/share/1704-map-hacking/map-hacking.Rdata\"))\n\n# fortify the spatial objects\nbord <- fortify(Sborders)\nfort <- fortify(Sn2, region = 'id')\n\nNext, I hack the geodata (long and lat variables) moving groups of NUTS-2 regions (Western, Southern, and Eastern Europe) apart. The appropriate values to move the groups of regions were found empirically.\n\n# hack geodata to separate macro-regions\nfort_hack <- fort %>% \n        left_join(df %>% select(id, subregion), 'id') %>% \n        mutate(long = ifelse(subregion=='E', long + 5e5, long),\n               long = ifelse(subregion=='S', long + 2e5, long),\n               lat = ifelse(subregion=='S', lat - 5e5, lat),\n               long = ifelse(subregion=='W', long - 2e5, long))\n\nFinally, we are ready to create the schematic map.\n\n# create color pallete\nbrbg <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11,\"BrBG\")\nbrbg4 <- brbg[c(4,9,2,11)]\n\n# create the two-dim legend\nggleg <- ggplot()+\n        coord_equal(xlim = c(0,1), ylim = c(0,1), expand = c(0,0))+\n        annotate('rect', xmin = .45, xmax = .6, ymin = .1, ymax = .25, \n                 fill = brbg4[1], color = NA)+\n        annotate('rect', xmin = .45, xmax = .6, ymin = .4, ymax = .55, \n                 fill = brbg4[2], color = NA)+\n        annotate('rect', xmin = .75, xmax = .9, ymin = .1, ymax = .25, \n                 fill = brbg4[3], color = NA)+\n        annotate('rect', xmin = .75, xmax = .9, ymin = .4, ymax = .55, \n                 fill = brbg4[4], color = NA)+\n        annotate('rect', xmin = .05, xmax = .95, ymin = .05, ymax = .95, \n                 fill = NA, color = \"grey20\")+\n        \n        annotate('text', x = .35, y = c(.175, .475), vjust = .5, hjust = 1,\n                 size = 6, fontface = 2, label = c('POOR', 'RICH'), family = font) + \n        annotate('text', x = c(.525, .825), y = .65, vjust = 0, hjust = .5,\n                 size = 6, fontface = 2, label = c('LOW', 'HIGH'), family = font)+\n        annotate('text', x = .1, y = .9, vjust = 1, hjust = 0,\n                 size = 7, fontface = 2, label = \"LEGEND\", family = font)+\n        theme_map()\n\n# create the blank map\nbasemap <- ggplot()+\n        coord_equal(ylim=c(900000,5400000), xlim=c(2500000, 7000000), expand = c(0,0))+\n        theme_map()+\n        theme(panel.border=element_rect(color = 'black',size=.5,fill = NA),\n              legend.position = 'none')\n\n# the main map\nmap_temp <- basemap + \n        geom_map(map = fort_hack, data = df, aes(map_id=id, fill=group))+\n        scale_fill_manual(values = brbg4[c(3, 1, 4, 2)])\n\n# now combine the map and the legend\nmap <- ggplot() + \n        coord_equal(xlim = c(0,1), ylim = c(0,1), expand = c(0,0))+\n        annotation_custom(ggplotGrob(map_temp), xmin = 0, xmax = 1, ymin = 0, ymax = 1)+\n        annotation_custom(ggplotGrob(ggleg), xmin = 0.72, xmax = 0.99, ymin = 0.72, ymax = 0.99)+\n        labs(title = \"Labour force and income in EU-27 NUTS-2 regions\",\n             subtitle = \"Within each of the three macro-regions of Europe - Westren, Southern, and Eastern -\\nNUTS-2 regions are classified in 4 groups according to the level of GDP per capita\\nand the share of working age population in 2008\",\n             caption = \"Data: Eurostat\\nAuthor: Ilya Kashnitsky (ikashnitsky.github.io)\")+\n        theme_ipsum_rc(plot_title_size = 30, subtitle_size = 20, caption_size = 15)\n\nAnd here is the result."

    "text": "Prospective ageing\nOver the past decades the alarmist views of the upcoming population ageing disaster became widely spread. True, with the growing number of countries approaching the ending of the Demographic Transition, the average/median age of their population increases rapidly, which is something unprecedented in the documented human history. But does that imply an unbearable burden of elderly population in the nearest future? Not necessarily.\nThe demographic prospects depend a lot on how we define ageing. Quite recently Waren Sanderson and Sergei Scherbov proposed 1 2 a new way to look at population ageing, they called it Prospective Ageing. The underlying idea is really simple – age is not static: a person aged 65 (the conventional border deliminating elderly population) today is in many aspects not the same as a person ages 65 half a century ago. Health and lifespan improved a lot in the last decades, meaning that today people generally have much more remaining years of life at the moment of being recognized as elderly by the conventional standards. Thus, Sanderson and Scherbov proposed to define elderly population based on the estimation of the expected remaining length of life rather than years lived. Such a refined view of population ageing disqualifies the alarmist claims of the approaching demographic collapse. The would be paradoxical title of one the latest papers of Sanderson and Scherbov 3 summarizes the phenomenon nicely: Faster Increases in Human Life Expectancy Could Lead to Slower Population Aging.1 Sanderson, W. C., & Scherbov, S. (2005). Average remaining lifetimes can increase as human populations age. Nature, 435(7043), 811–813.

It became usual to define this threshold at the remaining life expectancy of 15 years.4 See the working paper of my colleagues devoted to this question"

    "title": "What is life expectancy? And, even more important, what it isn’t",
    "section": "",
    "text": "It really is a remarkable achievement and maybe a lot of luck that the world mundanely operates with such a complex indicator as life expectancy. Unlike many statistics and quantities of general use that are being monitored and reported regularly, life expectancy is not observed directly. It’s an output of a mathematical model called life table. And as any model it comes with a certain load of assumptions and limitations, which are easily forgotten and omitted in the everyday interpretations and misinterpretations of the indicator.\nSo, why do we need any mathematical modelling in the first place? Consider a seemingly simple task: you want to know how long people live. What can be easier? Let’s just see how many years lived those who died recently. Why not? Such a metric would be massively driven by population age structure. For the most of the recent history human populations were rapidly growing, which means that each next generation was bigger than the previous one. Relative differences in the size of generations affect the age composition of those dying.\nOkay. Then why don’t we simply take a group of people born in the same year and see how long on average they live? We could (demographers call such groups cohorts). But it takes remarkably long to wait until the last person in the cohort dies. And we want to know what’s happening now.\nHow can we learn what’s happening now? Well, for that we need a mathematical model. We cannot observe the unfulfilled lifespans directly but we can construct/imagine an artificial population to help us understand the current mortality. The idea is simple: let’s take those dying now and divide them by the size of their age groups. This yields age-specific death rates – the key input for the life table needed to calculate life expectancy. Now, let’s take an imaginary cohort and see how long would they live on average if they experience these observed age-specific death rates. The imaginary population is know as a synthetic cohort. And here comes the main assumption of the life table: The model assumes that the observed age-specific death rates stay unchanged throughout the hypothetical lives of the hypothetical people in the synthetic cohort.\nThis big assumption of unchanging age profile of death rates almost never holds in real life. Mortality in human populations keeps improving beyond the most optimistic expectations. For decades the best demographers were systematically underestimating the progress in mortality reduction (Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002)\nThe horizontal lines are the limits of human population-level life expectancy as anticipated by renowned scholars; points are the actual data in the world leading countries. Source: (Oeppen and Vaupel, 2002)\nLife expectancy is a snapshot of the current mortality and is not a projection/forecast of the actual experience of the newborn cohorts. The current nature of period life expectancy is nicely illustrated by Dr. Robert Chung: “I have a car that can display”driving range” given its estimate of fuel level and how I’m driving. When climbing a steep hill, the range can decrease a lot; when descending, the range can increase. That’s what period e(x) is like.”\nBut if life expectancy talk about now and not the future, why is it called “expectancy” in the first place? This rather unfortunate and confusing naming comes from statistics, where “expected value” is a standard term for the mean of a distribution. The connotation crossing is rather unfortunate and as it strongly nudges the common future oriented misinterpretation of life expectancy.\nThe most popular error in public perception of period life expectancy forgets about the heavy assumption of the synthetic cohort (constant age-specific death rates throughout their hypothetic lives anchored in current year) and talks about the future of kids being born now. In normal years this large interpretation error is somewhat masked by the gradual and often close to linear improvements in mortality. A rule of thumb is to simply add ~6 years to period life expectancy to obtain a reasonable cohort estimate (Goldstein and Wachter, 2006). Mortality shocks like 2020 are a different story though. Here the “forward looking” (mis)interpretation of period life expectancy projects the shock levels of mortality into the future. Of course this doesn’t happen. Shocks are called shocks because they are temporal.\nAnother important detail that often misses public attention is that life expectancy is not a single value – it can be estimated for every age. Most often and by default life expectancy is reported “at birth”. But we can estimate remaining life expectancy for various ages. And here comes another popular misunderstanding of life expectancy. Too often we come across the references to human age and longevity in the past that sound something like: “She was 40, a very elderly lady by the standards of that time as people lived on average about 30 years back the”. True, there were times when life expectancy at birth was about 30 years even in the most developed now countries. This doesn’t mean though that those who outlived this threshold age were getting old at young (by our current standards) ages. Let me illustrate.\nLet’s take Italian male population in 1872, the first available year in Human Mortality Database. Have a look at the survival of this synthetic cohort – the proportion of the initial cohort that is still alive by certain age. Half of the synthetic cohort died by age 15!\nAnd here is how remaining period life expectancy looked by age. Infant and child mortality was sooo high that those escaping early deaths had higher remaining life expectancy.\nAt age 34 remaining life expectancy was the same as at birth. Only, it applied to the 41% survivors. And I guess the perception of age was not radically different among those survivors. It was all about selection and luck getting there. The high early life mortality is responsible for another popular demographic myth, which postulates that everybody used to have many kids in the past. No, people used to have many births, and only a fraction of those kids survived to adult life."
