Tiny things can separate life into "before" and "after". Here is one. For almost a year I've been daily sending mental "thank you" to [Ugo][ugo] who showed me how to re-organize panes in RStudio. Since then I've been spreading this tiny improvement so many times that I thought the tiny advise deserved a separate tiny post. Please note, below is an opinionated view of a comfortable UI improvement; feel free to ignore it if you don't like. This advise is **highly subjective**, though, I really believe it is useful. 

I find the default 4-pane layout of RStudio is not perfect. One needs more space for the "Source" pane. Especially when RStudio is used as the main text editor, i.e. **the** program to write code, papers, blog posts, prepare presentations... Thus, the perfect solution is to move "Console" to the top-right position, leave least useful "History" in the bottom-left corner and collapse it, and move everything else to the bottom-right corner (see the screenshot).

Just go to "Tools" --> "Global options" --> "Pane layout" and fix it.

That's it!


Just enjoy your improved RStudio, **the** program. 

P.S. It is also very handy to memorize and use the hot keys for panes. `CTRL + #` moves focus to the pane, `CTRL + SHIFT + #` maximizes the pane.
