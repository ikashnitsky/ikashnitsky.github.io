In the modern history, the world has seen unprecedented decrease in human mortality -- the result of the Demographic Transition. Initially, the improvements occurred only in the most developed societies, and by the mid XX century the world population was roughly divided in two parts according to mortality patterns (see the bi-modal distribution). After the 2nd World War, the developing countries started to catch up, and there was a clear convergence in life expectancy at birth, the most common summary measure of mortality.
