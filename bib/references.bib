	abstract = {Our recent study of 29 countries, which was published in IJE, highlights the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mortality across high-income countries.1 Period life expectancy witnessed declines in 2020 on a scale that is unprecedented in recent history. With the recent availability of data from Russia,2 we show that Russia is no exception (Figure 1). Data from death registrations indicate that life expectancy between 2019 and 2020 in Russia fell by -1.68 (95\% CI: -1.72, -1.63) years among males (from 68.41 to 66.73 years) and -1.80 (95\% CI: -1.85, -1.76) years for females (from 78.44 to 76.64 years). Comparisons of these losses with those among the 29 countries, as we previously reported,1 reveal that life expectancy losses among females were the largest in Russia, and losses among males stand only behind the USA (2.2 years) and Lithuania (1.7 years).},

	abstract = {Introduction The infection fatality rate (IFR) of COVID-19 has been carefully measured and analysed in high-income countries, whereas there has been no systematic analysis of age-specific seroprevalence or IFR for developing countries.
Methods We systematically reviewed the literature to identify all COVID-19 serology studies in developing countries that were conducted using representative samples collected by February 2021. For each of the antibody assays used in these serology studies, we identified data on assay characteristics, including the extent of seroreversion over time. We analysed the serology data using a Bayesian model that incorporates conventional sampling uncertainty as well as uncertainties about assay sensitivity and specificity. We then calculated IFRs using individual case reports or aggregated public health updates, including age-specific estimates whenever feasible.
Results In most locations in developing countries, seroprevalence among older adults was similar to that of younger age cohorts, underscoring the limited capacity that these nations have to protect older age groups.Age-specific IFRs were roughly 2 times higher than in high-income countries. The median value of the population IFR was about 0.5\%, similar to that of high-income countries, because disparities in healthcare access were roughly offset by differences in population age structure.
Conclusion The burden of COVID-19 is far higher in developing countries than in high-income countries, reflecting a combination of elevated transmission to middle-aged and older adults as well as limited access to adequate healthcare. These results underscore the critical need to ensure medical equity to populations in developing countries through provision of vaccine doses and effective medications.},

	abstract = {Objective To measure sex differences in lifespan based on the probability of males to outlive females.
Design International comparison of national and regional sex-specific life tables from the Human Mortality Database and the World Population Prospects.
Setting 199 populations spanning all continents, between 1751 and 2020.
Primary outcome measure We used the outsurvival statistic ( φ ) to measure inequality in lifespan between sexes, which is interpreted here as the probability of males to outlive females.
Results In random pairs of one male and one female at age 0, the probability of the male outliving the female varies between 25\% and 50\% for life tables in almost all years since 1751 and across almost all populations. We show that φ is negatively correlated with sex differences in life expectancy and positively correlated with the level of lifespan variation. The important reduction of lifespan inequality observed in recent years has made it less likely for a male to outlive a female.
Conclusions Although male life expectancy is generally lower than female life expectancy, and male death rates are usually higher at all ages, males have a substantial chance of outliving females. These findings challenge the general impression that ‘men do not live as long as women’ and reveal a more nuanced inequality in lifespans between females and males.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic triggered an unprecedented rise in mortality that translated into life expectancy losses around the world, with only a few exceptions. We estimate life expectancy changes in 29 countries since 2020 (including most of Europe, the United States and Chile), attribute them to mortality changes by age group and compare them with historic life expectancy shocks. Our results show divergence in mortality impacts of the pandemic in 2021. While countries in western Europe experienced bounce backs from life expectancy losses of 2020, eastern Europe and the United States witnessed sustained and substantial life expectancy deficits. Life expectancy deficits during fall/winter 2021 among people ages 60+ and {\textless}60 were negatively correlated with measures of vaccination uptake across countries (r60+ = −0.86; two-tailed P {\textless} 0.001; 95\% confidence interval, −0.94 to −0.69; r{\textless}60 = −0.74; two-tailed P {\textless} 0.001; 95\% confidence interval, −0.88 to −0.46). In contrast to 2020, the age profile of excess mortality in 2021 was younger, with those in under-80 age groups contributing more to life expectancy losses. However, even in 2021, registered COVID-19 deaths continued to account for most life expectancy losses.},
