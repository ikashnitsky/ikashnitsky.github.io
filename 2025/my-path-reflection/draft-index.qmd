<!-- my first non R post in the blog -->


- Very successful academic path
- Lack of own research topic
- Diverse experience: research in several fields of demography and in several countries and research teams, extensive teaching in several contexts, outreach, communication with journalists, R package development, blog and social media
- Tons of early career researchers career mentoring
- Lack of formal scientific mentoring
- Recent experience of giving feedback to Sebastian
- I'm ready to be a scientific mentor now!
