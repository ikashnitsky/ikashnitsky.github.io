Here it is:\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-screen-inset}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](compare-poster.png){width=1756}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poster compares population age structures, represented as ternary compositions in three broad age groups, of European NUTS-3 regions and the United States counties. I used ternary color-coding, a dataviz approach that [Jonas Schöley][js] and me recently brought to R in [tricolore][tric] package. \n\nIn these maps, each region's population age composition is uniquely color-coded. Colors show direction and magnitude of deviation from the center point, which represents the average age composition. Hue component of a color encodes the direction of deviation: towards yellow – more elderly population (65+); cyan – more people at working ages (15–64); magenta–more kids (<15).\n\nOf course, NUTS-3 regions and the US counties are not perfect to compare; on average, NUTS-3 regions are roughly ten times bigger. That's why the colors for European regions look quite muted, they are closer to the grey average composition.\n\n\nThe poster won [NVD][nvd] Poster Award via online voting of the conference participants.\n\n![](poster-award.png)\n\n***\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Replication \nThis time I layouted the poster in [Inkscape][ink] rather than arranging everything with hundreds of R code lines. But all the elements of the posted are reproducible with code from [this github repo][repo].\n:::\n\n\n::: {.callout-note}\n# See also\n - [Kashnitsky, I., & Schöley, J. (2018).
