The history of NUTS dates back to the beginning of 1970s, when European countries developed unified standards for systems of administrative geography. It was not until the beginning of this century when such a system finally became widely used. There are three main hierarchical levels of NUTS, and the most commonly used for regional analysis is NUTS-2.\n\n![](fig-01-nuts.png){width=\"60%\"}  \n\n**Figure 1. Illustration of the principle of NUTS hierarchical system**\n\nOne of the objectives of NUTS was to provide more or less comparable administrative divisions for all countries of Europe. Nevertheless, in 2013, population figures for single NUTS-2 regions ranged from 28.5 thousands in *Aland island* (Finland) to almost 12 million in *Ile-de-France* (Paris and surroundings, France).   \n\n\n# The broken time series\n\nQuite arbitrary in its essence, territorial division tends to evolve. Changes in administrative boundaries can cause problems for regional analysis as they break the time series and therefore make it harder to analyze trends. Despite this inconvenience, the boundaries of regions actually change quite often based on the needs and interests of local or national governmenta. Eurostat [tracks all modifications][nuts-hist] providing detailed explanations of all the changes that happen between versions of NUTS (figure 2). \n\n![](fig-02-nuts-changes.png) \n**Figure 2. Changes in NUTS between versions 2006 and 2010**\n\nDespite this, Eurostat does not recalculate historic demographic data to match the most recent NUTS version. This means that, for the most recent version of NUTS, there is missing data for all years before the latest administrative change. So researchers have to reconstruct historical data manually to obtain a long time series. Of course, crude assumptions often have to be accepted in order to approximate the population figures for the current regions that did not exist in the past. \n\nTo make thing even more complex, Eurostat provides the data only for the latest version of NUTS (at least, I did not work out how to download previous versions). In [my PhD project][phd] I carry out regional analysis for the NUTS-2 regions of European Union. To have the longest possible time series, when I did the data preparation in 2015, I chose the 2010 version of NUTS, on which the regional demographic projection [EUROPOP2013][proj] is based. For reproducibility, I uploaded the precise versions of the Eurostat data at NUTS-2 level on [population age structures][pop] and [deaths][deaths], as downloaded in 2015, to [figshare][figshare].  \n\n\n# Denmark\n\nSome countries had to perform major changes in their systems of territorial division to fit the NUTS standards. [The most significant reform happened in Denmark in 2007][reform], where the former 271 municipalities were transformed into the new 98 municipalities. At the same time, NUTS was introduced, so that 98 municipalities were allocated to 11 NUTS-3 regions, which aggregate to 5 NUTS-2 regions. Typically, for a small country, there is only one NUTS-1 region in Denmark, which is the whole country.\n\nAs far as I know, there was no official attempt of Eurostat to reconstruct the time series for Denmark before 2007. The typical map of Eurostat for the pre-2007 period shows Denmark as “no data available” country (figure 3). \n\n![](fig-03-nuts-2-life-exp.png)\n**Figure 3. Life expectancy at birth in European NUTS-2 regions,  2006; a screenshot from the Eurostat's [interactive data exploratory tool][eurostat-map]**\n\nSuch a data loss is somewhat surprising for a country such as Denmark. It might be quite difficult to match the old and new municipal systems; but it should be relatively easy to re-aggregate the old municipalities into the new (higher level) NUTS regions. That is precisely what I did during my data preparation[^2] and what I now want to share in this post.\n\nThe task is basically to identify which of the old 271 municipalities are located within the modern 11 NUTS-3 regions and to aggregate the municipal data. Then, NUTS-3 data is easily aggregated for the NUTS-2 level. Such a task could have meant working late into the night, but luckily we live in the GIS era. I used GIS to match the old municipalities with the NUTS-3 regions. Here I want to show (with code) how the task can be performed using the amazing and opensource [R][cran]. Below I show the process of matching old municipalities to the NUTS regions and the process that I used to aggregate population data.\n\n\n# Data\n\nThe data on the population age structures for the old 271 municipalities of Denmark was downloaded from the [official website of Statistics Denmark][stat-den]. The system only allows you to grab up to 10K cells for unregistered users and up to 100K for registered users. So the process of downloading the data involves some tedious manual manipulations. For the purpose of my phd project, I downloaded the data for the period 2001-2006; but, if needed, the data is available since 1979. The data, downloaded in 2015 and ‘tidied up’ can be found [here][data-mun-pop].\n\nI have spent a lot of time trying to find geodata with the boundaries of the old municipalities. Now, coming back to the topic more than 1.5 year later, I failed to identify the original source of the shapefile, though I am pretty sure that it came from [here][aalborg] [^3]. The copy of the shapefile that I used can be found [here][geo-old].\n\nFinally, we need a shapefile of NUTS-3 regions. It can be easily downloaded from [Eurostat geodata repository][eur-geo]. The shapefile that I used is \"NUTS_2010_20M_SH.zip\". The selection of the 11 Danish regions can be found [here][geo-dk]. \n\nThe projection used for both shapefiles is [ESPG-3044][dk-prj], the one often used to map Denmark.\n\nNow, the code to prepare the R session and load the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# set locale and encoding parameters to read Danish\nif(Sys.info()['sysname']==\"Linux\"){\n        Sys.setlocale(\"LC_CTYPE\", \"da_DK.utf8\")\n        danish_ecnoding <- \"WINDOWS-1252\"\n}else if(Sys.info()['sysname']==\"Windows\"){\n        Sys.setlocale(\"LC_CTYPE\", \"danish\")\n        danish_ecnoding <- \"Danish_Denmark.1252\"\n}\n\n# load required packages (install first if needed)\nlibrary(tidyverse) # version: 1.0.0\nlibrary(ggthemes) # version: 3.3.0\nlibrary(rgdal) # version: 1.2-4\nlibrary(rgeos) # version: 0.3-21\nlibrary(RColorBrewer) # version: 1.1-2\nmypal <- brewer.pal(11, \"BrBG\")\nlibrary(fuzzyjoin) # version: 0.1.2\nlibrary(viridis) # version: 0.3.4\n\n# load Denmark pop structures for the old municipalities\ndf <- read_csv(\"https://ikashnitsky.github.io/share/1703-nuts2-denmark/BEF1A.csv.gz\")\n\n# create a directory for geodata\nifelse(!dir.exists(\"geodata\"), dir.create(\"geodata\"), \"Directory already exists\")\n\n# download, unzip and read Danish NUTS-3 geodata (31KB)\nurl_nuts <- \n    \"https://ikashnitsky.github.io/share/1703-nuts2-denmark/denmark-nuts3-espg3044.tgz\"\npath_nuts <- \"geodata/denmark-nuts3-espg3044.tgz\"\nifelse(\n    !file.exists(path_nuts), \n    download.file(url_nuts, path_nuts, mode=\"wb\"), \n    'file alredy exists'\n)\n# If there are problems downloading the data automatically, please download it from\n# https://ikashnitsky.github.io/share/1703-nuts2-denmark/denmark-nuts3-espg3044.tgz\nuntar(tarfile = path_nuts, exdir = \"geodata\")\n\nsp_nuts3 <- readOGR(dsn = \"geodata/.\", layer = \"denmark-nuts3-espg3044\")\ngd_nuts3 <- fortify(sp_nuts3, region = \"NUTS_ID\") # to the ggplot format\n\n\n# download, unzip and read Danish old municipal geodata (6.0MB)\nurl_mun <- \n    \"https://ikashnitsky.github.io/share/1703-nuts2-denmark/kommune2006win1252.tgz\"\npath_mun <- \"geodata/kommune2006win1252.tgz\"\nifelse(\n    !file.exists(path_mun), \n    download.file(url_mun, path_mun, mode=\"wb\"), \n    'file alredy exists'\n)\n# If there are problems downloading the data automatically, please download it from\n# https://ikashnitsky.github.io/share/1703-nuts2-denmark/kommune2006utf8.tgz\nuntar(tarfile = path_mun, exdir = \"geodata\")\n\nsp_mun <- readOGR(\n    dsn = \"geodata/.\", layer = \"kommune2006win1252\", encoding = danish_ecnoding\n) \ngd_mun <- fortify(sp_mun)\n\n# coordinates of the municipalities\nmun_coord <- bind_cols(as.data.frame(coordinates(sp_mun)), sp_mun@data[,1:3]) |> \n        transmute(long = V1, lat = V2, enhedid, objectid, name = navn)\n```\n:::\n\n  \n\n# Spatial matching\n\nLet's first have a look at the map.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot()+\n        geom_polygon(data = gd_nuts3, aes(long, lat, group = group), \n                     color = brbg[3], fill = \"grey90\", size = 1)+\n        geom_point(data = mun_coord, aes(long, lat), \n                   color = brbg[10], size = 1)+\n        theme_map()\n```\n:::\n\n\n![](fig-04-ref-map.png)\n**Figure 4. Reference map of the old municipalities and NUTS-3 regions of Denmark**\n\nWe can easily see that the boundaries of the municipalities (light blue) are much more precise than that of the NUTS-3 regions (orange/brown). This is not a problem as long as all the centroids of the municipalities fall within the boundaries of the NUTS-3 regions, which seems to be true for all municipalities except for the easternmost one. A quick check reveals that this is [Christiansø][ch], a tiny fortified island, whose [history][ch-hist] goes back to the Middle Ages. It has a special status and [is not included][ch-stat-dk] into the NUTS system. For further manipulations, Christiansø can safely merge it with the close-by Bornholm.\n\nTo identify which municipalities fall into which NUTS regions, I use the spatial overlap function (`over`) from `sp` package.

Re-checking the spatial intersection between the old municipalities and NUTS-3 regions of Denmark**\n\nNow everything seems okay. \n\n\n# Joining spatial and statistical data (fuzzy join)\n\nThe next task is to join the spatial data and statistical data together. The spatial layer for municipalities does not contain the codes that are used by Statistics Denmark, so I have to match municipalities in the two datasets by their names. This is quite a difficult task. Names can be written slightly differently, there are some special characters in Danish alphabet, and some municipalities may have experienced a change of name. To solve the task most efficiently, I used the ‘Fuzzy String Matching’ approach which is implemented in the  [`fuzzyjoin`][fuz] package by [David Robinson][drob].\n\nFirst, I simplify the names in both datasets turning them into lowercase, replacing the character “å” with “aa”, and removing the “Kommune” word in the spatial dataset names. Please note that I downloaded (separately) a small selection from Statistics Denmark to have a [lightweight dataframe][stat-names] with municipal codes and names.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# simplify municipalities names\nmun_geo <- mun_coord |>         \n        transmute(name = sub(x = name, \" Kommune\", replacement = \"\"), objectid) |> \n        mutate(name = gsub(x = tolower(name), \"å\", \"aa\"))\n\nmun_stat <- read.csv2(\n    \"https://ikashnitsky.github.io/share/1703-nuts2-denmark/stat-codes-names.csv\", \n    fileEncoding = danish_ecnoding\n) |> \n        select(name) |> \n        separate(name, into = c(\"code\", \"name\"), sep = \" \", extra = \"merge\") |> \n        mutate(name = gsub(\"\\\\s*\\\\([^\\\\)]+\\\\)\", \"\", x = name)) |> \n        mutate(name = gsub(x = tolower(name), \"å\", \"aa\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's try fuzzy join.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# first attempt\nfuz_joined_1 <- regex_left_join(mun_geo, mun_stat, by = \"name\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe resulting dataframe has 278 rows instead of 271. That means that for some municipalities in the spatial dataset there was more than one match. Let’s identify them.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# identify more that 1 match (7 cases) and select which to drop\nfuz_joined_1 |> group_by(objectid) |> mutate(n = n()) |> filter(n > 1)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n## Source: local data frame [14 x 5]\n## Groups: objectid [7]\n## \n##         name.x objectid  code      name.y     n\n##          <chr>    <dbl> <chr>       <chr> <int>\n## 1       haslev   105112   313      haslev     2\n## 2       haslev   105112   403       hasle     2\n## 3  brønderslev    47003   739       rønde     2\n## 4  brønderslev    47003   805 brønderslev     2\n## 5    hirtshals    47037   817        hals     2\n## 6    hirtshals    47037   819   hirtshals     2\n## 7      rønnede    46378   385     rønnede     2\n## 8      rønnede    46378   407       rønne     2\n## 9     hvidebæk    46268   317    hvidebæk     2\n## 10    hvidebæk    46268   681     videbæk     2\n## 11    ryslinge    46463   477    ryslinge     2\n## 12    ryslinge    46463   737          ry     2\n## 13     aarslev    46494   497     aarslev     2\n## 14     aarslev    46494   861        aars     2\n```\n:::\n\n\nSo, for 7 municipalities, two matches were found. I will drop the imperfect match variants in the next iteration of fuzzy join.\n\nThe other issue is the municipalities for which no match was found in that statistical data. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# show the non-matched cases\nfuz_joined_1 |> filter(is.na(code))\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n##              name.x objectid code name.y\n## 1              faxe   105120 <NA>   <NA>\n## 2 nykøbing falsters    46349 <NA>   <NA>\n## 3       herstederne    46101 <NA>   <NA>\n```\n:::\n\n\nAs there are only three such cases, I corrected them manually in the spatial data to match the statistical data.
