The sex ratio at birth does not vary dramatically[^1] and is more or less constant at the level of 105-106 boys per 100 girls. Hence, differences in the sex ratio profiles of countries mainly reflect gender gap in mortality. In this post I will compare sex ratios age profiles in all countries included in [Human Mortality Database](http://www.mortality.org).\n\n[^1]: There are cases of big deviations from this natural constant. The most well known one is the skewed sex ratio in China, where decades of One Child Policy together with strong traditional son preference resulted in selective abortions.

Thanks to [Tim Riffe's](https://sites.google.com/site/timriffepersonal/) `HMDHFDplus` package, one can now download HMD data with just a couple of lines of `R` code. \n \nThere is a handy function in `HMDHFDplus` package -- `getHMDcountries()`. It lists the codes for all countries in HMD. So it becomes really easy to loop through the database and download data for all countries.\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse) # version 1.0.0\nlibrary(HMDHFDplus) # version 1.1.8\n\ncountry <- getHMDcountries()\n\nexposures <- list()\nfor (i in 1: length(country)) {\n        cnt <- country[i]\n        exposures[[cnt]] <- readHMDweb(cnt, \"Exposures_1x1\",\n                                       ik_user_hmd, ik_pass_hmd)\n        \n        # let's print the progress\n        paste(i,'out of',length(country)) \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.callout-important}\n# Use own credentials \nPlease note, the arguments `ik_user_hmd` and `ik_pass_hmd` are my login credentials at the website of [Human Mortality Database](http://www.mortality.org), which are stored locally at my computer. In order to access the data, one needs to create an account at [www.mortality.org](https://www.mortality.org/) and provide his own credentials to the `readHMDweb()` function.\n:::\n\nNext, I select 2012 for comparison -- it is quite recent, and for most of the HMD countries there are data for 2012. The loop goes through each of the countries' dataframe in `exposures` list, selects data for 2012 and calculates sex ratio at each age. I also remove data for several populations (like East and West Germany separately). \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsr_age <- list()\n\nfor (i in 1:length(exposures)) {\n        di <- exposures[[i]]\n        sr_agei <- di |> select(Year,Age,Female,Male) |> \n                filter(Year %in% 2012) |>\n                select(-Year) |>\n                transmute(country = names(exposures)[i],\n                          age = Age, sr_age = Male / Female * 100)\n        sr_age[[i]] <- sr_agei\n}\nsr_age <- bind_rows(sr_age)\n\n# remove optional populations\nsr_age <- sr_age |> \n    filter(!country %in% c(\"FRACNP\",\"DEUTE\",\"DEUTW\",\"GBRCENW\",\"GBR_NP\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nAfter age 90, sex ratios become quite jerky due to the relatively small numbers of survivors. I decided to aggregate data after the age 90.  \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# summarize all ages older than 90 (too jerky)\nsr_age_90 <- sr_age |> filter(age %in% 90:110) |> \n        group_by(country) |> summarise(sr_age = mean(sr_age, na.rm = T)) |>\n        ungroup() |> transmute(country, age=90, sr_age)\n\ndf_plot <- bind_rows(sr_age |> filter(!age %in% 90:110), sr_age_90)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I plot the resulting sex ratios.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get nice font\nlibrary(extrafont)\nmyfont <- \"Roboto Condensed\"\n\n# finaly - plot\ngg <- ggplot(df_plot, aes(age, sr_age, color = country, group = country))+\n        geom_hline(yintercept = 100, color = 'grey50', size = 1)+\n        geom_line(size = 1)+\n        scale_y_continuous(\n            limits = c(0, 120), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 120, 20)\n        )+\n        scale_x_continuous(\n            limits = c(0, 90), expand = c(0, 0), breaks = seq(0, 80, 20)\n        )+\n        xlab('Age')+\n        ylab('Sex ratio, males per 100 females')+\n        facet_wrap(~country, ncol=6)+\n        theme_minimal(base_family = myfont, base_size = 15)+\n        theme(legend.position='none',\n              panel.border = element_rect(size = .5, fill = NA))\n\ngg\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n![](hmd-sex-ratios.png)\n\nThere is quite a variety in the sex ratio profiles. If the initial prevalence of males equalizes in Japan, Sweden, or Norway at around 60, in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine this happens at around 30 due to very high male mortality. In many countries there are pronounced bumps in the sex ratio at ages 20-30, that are likely to be caused by international migration. For example, Scotland, Northern Ireland, Portugal, and New Zealand are experiencing substantial outflow of young men.\n\nWhat happened in Taiwan?\n\n\n***\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# This post is based on my earlier [tweet](https://twitter.com/ikashnitsky/status/785973218775478273) and [gist](https://gist.github.com/ikashnitsky/a578eaef6b122aa2aa2e3469fd2dcbe7)\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n",
